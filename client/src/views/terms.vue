        (the “Documentation”), as well as all information data made available to
        you in connection with the Service (“Data,” together with the Service
        and Documentation, the “App”). By using or accessing any part of the
        App, you are agreeing to these Terms and all other applicable policies
        and notices, as made available to you from time to time. In addition, if
        you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal
        entity, you hereby warrant that you have authority to bind such entity
        to these Terms, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to
        such entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t agree to these Terms or you do not have authority to enter
        into these Terms, you must not accept these Terms and may not use any
        part of the App. We may amend these Terms at any time by posting an
        amended version on the Service. You can determine when these Terms were
        last modified by checking the “Last updated” notice on the top of the
        Agreement. Your continued use of the Site or Services shall constitute
        your consent to any changes made. If you do not agree to the new or
        different terms, you should not use the App. These Terms may not be
        otherwise amended.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not access any part of our App if you are a direct competitor of
        ours, except with our prior written consent. In addition, you may not

        or data or information in, the App, and/or (iii) monitoring its
        availability, performance or functionality, or for any other

      <h5><strong>3. Accounts; Password; Security:</strong></h5>
      <p>
        You may need to set up an account in order to use some of the features
        of the App (an “<strong>Account</strong>”). When you are setting up your
        Account, you must give us accurate and complete information. You may not
        use someone else’s account without permission. This means that you
        cannot set up an account using someone else’s name or contact
        information, or a phony name or phony contact information. You are
        solely responsible for the activity that occurs in your Account, and you
        must keep your Account password secure. If you find out that someone is
        using your Account without your permission, you must let us know
        immediately. You may not transfer your Account to someone else. We are
        not liable for any damages or losses caused by someone using your
        account without your permission. However, if we (or anyone else) suffer
        any damage due to the unauthorized use of your account, you may be
        liable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the App, we may obtain access to your name, e-mail address,
        company, and location. Our use of any personally identifiable
        information you provide to us as part of the registration process is
        governed by the terms of our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5><strong>4. License to Use our Service:</strong></h5>
      <p>
        We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable,
        non-assignable, non-transferable, revocable right to use the App solely
        for your internal business operations and in accordance with these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree not to, and shall not permit any third party to: (i) access
        any part of the App without our consent, (ii) modify, translate, reverse
        engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works of or copy any
        part of the App or otherwise seek to obtain or use the source code or
        non-public APIs of any part of the App, except to the extent expressly
        permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance written notice
        to WhiteSource), (iii) remove, alter or obscure any proprietary notices,
        labels or marks on any component or portion of the App, (iv) market,

        the App, (vi) use any part of the App for the benefit of any third party
        including use of the Service to operate as a service bureau, or hosting
        service, and/or (vii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of
        the App, or their related systems or networks; (viii) breach any
        applicable local, national or international law, rule or regulation; or
        (ix) transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains
        viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware,
        adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed

        <li><strong> Proprietary Rights to the App:</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The App is licensed and not sold to you under these Terms and you
        acknowledge that &nbsp;WhiteSource and its licensors retain all right,
        title and interest (including all copyright, trade secret, patent and
        other rights) in and to the App anywhere in the world (even after
        installation onto a computer owned by you or integration into your
        system), and that you have no rights in or to any part of the App other
        than the right to use each of them in accordance with these Terms. If
        you give feedback, suggestions or any other information relating to your
        use of the App, for example recommendations for improvements or features
        (“Feedback”), that Feedback is solely owned by us and may become part of
        the App without any compensation to you. We reserve all rights in and to
        the App unless we expressly state otherwise. The App contains
        proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable
        intellectual property and other laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that you breach the terms of the license granted to you
        herein and such breach results in the creation of derivative works of
        any part of the App (“Derivative Works”), you hereby assign with full
        right and title guarantee all such Derivative Works to us. Such
        assignment does not preclude us from taking any legal or other action
        against you for contravention of these Terms, including for infringement
        of our intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content on the App is provided to you “as is” for your personal use
        only and may not be used, copied, distributed, transmitted, broadcast,
        displayed, sold, licensed, de-compiled, or otherwise exploited for any
        other purposes whatsoever without our prior written consent.&nbsp; If
        you download or print a copy of the content you must retain all
        copyright and other proprietary notices contained therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        All brand, product and service names used in the App which identify
        WhiteSource or our licensors and our or their proprietary products and
        services are the trademarks or service marks of WhiteSource or our
        licensors. Nothing in the App shall be deemed to confer on any person
        any license or right on the part of WhiteSource or such App with respect
        to any such image, logo or name. We reserve all rights not expressly
        granted herein to the App.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5><strong>6. Project Data and Rights you give us:</strong></h5>
      <p>
        We claim no intellectual property rights in and to your applications,
        project or any material you provide or otherwise transmit to us via the
        Service and you will be solely responsible for the accuracy, quality and
        legality of the information transmitted to us via the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enable your use of the App, we need to inspect portions of your
        project and send parts of it to our servers. This information includes,
        but is not limited to, information relating to the project (such as the
        project name and metadata), information on dependencies, how the
        dependencies are being used and how they are referenced by the project
        and WhiteSource-related files (“Project Information”). We may also
        collect Project Information for each of the project’s dependencies
        (“Dependency Information”). For these purposes, we require, and you
        hereby grant us, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free license to
        store, use, reproduce, display and transmit the Project Information, the
        Dependency Information and any other materials transmitted via the
        Service to the extent necessary to enable your use of the App, including
        monitoring services. This license shall remain in effect until and
        unless these Terms of Service are terminated by you or us.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the rights granted to us above, we also require, and you
        hereby grant to us, a license to store, use, reproduce, display and
        transmit the Project Information, the Dependency Information and any
        other materials transmitted via the Service for analytical purposes and
        to improve our App. For the avoidance of doubt, this license will not
        end upon termination of these Terms of Service or where you delete the
        relevant project on the project page of the Microsoft Visual Studio
        Marketplace Platform.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5><strong>7. Usage Data Analysis:</strong></h5>
      <p>
        WhiteSource reserves the right to compile, maintain and use statistical,
        metric and performance information regarding your use of the App (the
        “Usage Information”), and you understand and acknowledge that the
        Service may contain a feature that sends Usage Information along with
        other technical information regarding the operation of the Service to
        WhiteSource. This information is used by us for analytical purposes and
        to improve our App. It allows us to better understand how the App is
        used and informs our product development decisions.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5><strong>8. Warranty:</strong></h5>

        defense and control of any matter which is subject to an indemnification

      <p>
        If we terminate your use of the App for any of these reasons or
        otherwise for cause, we will not refund any fees you may have paid for

      <p>
        Upon any termination we may delete your account and passwords and we may

        or functionality to the App. These Terms will apply to such new
        services, features or functionality, unless they come with separate or
        additional terms, in which case you will be required to agree to such
        separate or additional terms before being permitted to use the new
        services, features or functionality.

        so.&nbsp; Such Revisions will be supplied according to our then-current
        policies, which may include automatic updating or upgrading without any
        additional notice to you.&nbsp; You consent to any such automatic
        updating or upgrading of the App.&nbsp; All references herein to the App
        shall include Revisions.&nbsp; These Terms shall govern any Revisions
        that replace or supplement the original App, unless the Revision is

      <h5><strong>17. Assignment</strong></h5>
      <p>
        These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
        transferred or assigned by you but may be assigned by WhiteSource
        without restriction or notification to you. Any prohibited assignment
        shall be null and void.

      <h5><strong>18. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction:</strong></h5>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service shall be construed and governed in accordance
        with the laws of Israel (except for conflict of law provisions) and only
        the courts in Israel shall have jurisdiction in any conflict or dispute
        arising out of these Terms. The application of the United Nations
        Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
        excluded. The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted
        hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any
        breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to
        subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of
        future breaches.

      <h5><strong>19.</strong> <strong>General </strong></h5>
      <p>
        These Terms shall constitute the entire agreement between you and
        WhiteSource concerning the Site.&nbsp; If any provision of these Terms
        is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
        of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
        provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and
        effect.&nbsp; No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a
        further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a
        party’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall
        not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
