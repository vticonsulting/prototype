      title="Joined the Nuxt.js Core Team"
      when="September 2018"
    >
      Since the beginning of 2018, Nuxt.js was my framework of choice to fulfill
      a variety of tasks. After getting in touch with the community, I couldn't
      let it go! Contributing meaningful parts to such an awesome and large
      project felt great. Over time I dug into the internals of Nuxt and got
      used to the code base, also thanks to the other core maintainers. At VueJs
      London, where I met the Chopin brothers, who are the originators of Nuxt,
      the first time, they surprisingly announced two new core team members. I
      was one of them.

      That was a long term goal I wanted to achieve. Building my own blog system
      with the tools I use in daily work and finally write about interesting
      technical stuff (and maybe other topics as well)! After working towards
      this goal (when I had time) for half a year, I eventually launched the

      After talking with a lot of people about my choice of programming
      languages, I decided to work on a talk about PHP, it's flaws and

      Before applying to companies all over the world for my upcoming semester

    <TimelineItem title="First internship" when="November 11, 2011">
      In the 9th grade, we had to fulfill a work experience at a company of our
      choice. Of course, we must apply for that internship regularly. I first
      thought of working at a computer repair company to gain knowledge about
      the hardware, but then I applied at a smaller software company in my town
      and they accepted my application!
      <br /><br />
      My first task was testing their current system and trying to break it.
      After reporting the found bugs and caveats they noticed that my
      understanding was quite good for a 15-year-old guy, so the follow-up tasks
      were more complex and deep, like creating configs and setting up the
      database.
